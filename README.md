## ✅ Task 1: Machine Down Time Analysis in Tableau

### 🎯 Objective

Use telemetry data to visualize machine downtime and answer:

* In which **location** did machines break the most?
* What **machine types** broke most often in that location?

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. **Download & Install Tableau**

* Visit [Tableau Free Trial](https://www.tableau.com/products/trial)
* Use your email to **download** and **register** Tableau.

#### 2. **Download & Import Data**

* Download the file: `daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip` from the resources.
* Unzip it.
* Open Tableau → **Connect** → Choose `JSON` → Import `daikibo-telemetry-data.json`.

#### 3. **Create a Calculated Field**

* Go to **Data Pane** → Right-click → *Create Calculated Field*
* Name: `Unhealthy`
* Formula:

  ```plaintext
  IF [Status] = "Unhealthy" THEN 10 ELSE 0 END
  ```
* This represents **10 minutes** of downtime per "Unhealthy" status.

#### 4. **Create First Sheet: "Down Time per Factory"**

* Drag `Factory` to Columns.
* Drag `Unhealthy` to Rows.
* Set aggregation to **SUM**.
* Sort bars descending by downtime.
* Rename Sheet: `Down Time per Factory`

#### 5. **Create Second Sheet: "Down Time per Device Type"**

* Drag `Device Type` to Columns.
* Drag `Unhealthy` to Rows.
* Filter: Select a specific factory if needed.
* Rename Sheet: `Down Time per Device Type`

#### 6. **Build a Dashboard**

* Click `New Dashboard`.
* Drag both sheets onto the dashboard.
* Click the first chart → Use as Filter (right-click on chart).
* When a factory is selected, the second chart updates accordingly.

#### 7. **Capture & Submit**

* Click on the factory bar with **highest downtime**.
* Take a screenshot of your dashboard.
* Save and submit as instructed.

### What is the outcome of the Analysis?

## 📊 Downtime Analysis Summary

### 🔍 Key Findings:

1. **Factory-Level Downtime**:

   * **Daikibo-Factory-Seiko** experienced the highest downtime with **480 unhealthy units**, indicating significant production issues.
   * **Daikibo-Shenzhen** followed with **420 units**, showing potential maintenance gaps.
   * **Daikibo-Factory-Meiyo** showed moderate downtime at **110 units**.
   * **Daikibo-Berlin** had the **least downtime (20 units)**, suggesting strong equipment health and operational efficiency.

2. **Device-Level Downtime**:

   * **Laser Welder** had the highest downtime among all devices (**480 units**), followed closely by the **Laser Cutter (430 units)**.
   * Other devices such as **Heavy Duty Drill (70 units)** and **Furnace (20 units)** contributed moderately.
   * Devices like **Metal Press** and **Air Wrench** reported **zero downtime**, highlighting their reliability.

### 📌 Conclusion:

* The major contributors to downtime are specific devices like **Laser Welder** and **Laser Cutter**, and factories such as **Seiko** and **Shenzhen**.
* These insights can guide **preventive maintenance** planning, **equipment upgrades**, and **process optimization** in the most affected areas.
* Learning from **Berlin's efficiency** could help improve performance across other locations.

### ✅ Task 2: Create Equality Classification in Excel
🎯 Objective
Generate a new column Equality Class based on the values in the Equality Score column.

### 🧰 Tools Required
Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Open the Dataset
File: Equality Table.xlsx (or .csv)

### Open in Excel

2. Add a New Column
Column D → Header: Equality Class

In cell D2, paste:

```plaintext
=IF(ABS(C2)>20, "Highly Discriminative", IF(ABS(C2)>10, "Unfair", "Fair"))
```

3. Drag Formula Down Fill the formula through all rows

### 4. Validate a Few Rows
   
* -25 → Highly Discriminative

* -15 → Unfair

*  → Fair

### 5. Save Your File
Save as: Equality Table - Updated.xlsx

### 🧾 Example Data Preview
* Factory	Job Role	Equality Score	Equality Class
* Daikibo Meiyo	C-Level	-25	Highly Discriminative
* Daikibo Seiko	Manager	-21	Highly Discriminative
* Daikibo Shenzhen	Engineer	4	Fair

### ✅ Confirm your file looks like this before submitting.

### 📥 Resources
* Tableau Trial
* Excel Online


### 📌 Submission Checklist
* Task	Requirement	Done
* Task 1	Dashboard created in Tableau	✅
* Task 1	Screenshot taken of filtered dashboard	✅
* Task 2	Excel formula applied	✅
* Task 2	File saved with Equality Class column	✅
